History
</h1>

<hr>
<p>
Arab traders provided the first written accounts of the Gambia area in <b>the ninth and tenth centuries. During the tenth century</b>, Muslim merchants and scholars established communities in several West African commercial centres. Both groups established trans-Saharan trade routes, leading to a large export trade in slaves, gold and ivory, as well as imports of manufactured goods.
<br/>
<em>By the 11th or 12th century, the rulers of kingdoms such as Takrur</em>, a monarchy centred on the Senegal River just to the north, ancient Ghana and Gao had converted to Islam and had appointed to their courts Muslims who were literate in the Arabic language.[20] At the beginning of the 14th century, most of what is today called Gambia was part of the Mali Empire. The Portuguese reached this area by sea in the mid-15th century, and began to dominate overseas trade.
